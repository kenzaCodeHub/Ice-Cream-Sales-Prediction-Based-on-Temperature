# Ice-Cream-Sales-Prediction-Based-on-Temperature

This project uses linear regression to analyze the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. By providing a dataset of temperatures and corresponding sales, the model can predict ice cream sales for a given temperature.

## Description

The project performs the following steps:
- **Data Processing**: Converts sales data from strings to numerical values.
- **Model Training**: Fits a linear regression model to find the relationship between temperature and sales.
- **Visualization**: Plots the data points and the linear regression line to show the trend.
- **Prediction**: Uses the model to predict sales at a specified temperature (e.g., 15Â°C).
